      This section of the site is there to inform you about the policies and how
      I gather the data to offer the provided services. <br />

      First and foremost: Your data is in save hands. Whenever you are unsure
      how your data is processed and used, take a look at the
      <a href="https://github.com/Dakantz/spotify-365-day-rewind">repository</a
      >, where the whole code of this site is accesible to everyone, including
      recommendations or fixes.<br /><br />
      And no, I don't store any passwords - your account is authenticated using
      OAuth and a key exchange, where you have to agree to share the data with
      me. To provide my services, the key is stored on my side to renew and
      re-authenticate in order to record your listening history. Every other
      permission is needed to enable further, additional features of the site
      (email notifications, etc.).<br /><br />
      If you are uncomfortable or don't like where I am taking the project, you
      can either:<br />
      <ul>
        <li>Delete your data, or</li>
        <li>
          Write me on <a href="https://twitter.com/dakantz">twitter</a>, or
        </li>
        <li>
          Write me an e-mail to
          <a href="mailto:benedikt@kantz.at">benedikt@kantz.at</a>, or
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      If you are interested in helping and taking this project further, write
      using one the above mentioned ways!<br /><br />

        P.S.: I run this site out of my own pocket (~ 40â‚¬/year), if you like to
        support this project financially, let me know!
